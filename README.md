# 2048 - Python Version

This is a simple port of 2048 to python. The scoring is kept simple, and the game allows you to continue even after the 2048 tile has been reached.

#### GUI
There's a simple gui in place for the game, but it requires other modules I've since lost access to. However, the key game logic is still in place, and a game is represented as a class with several possible functions and a game state represented by a list of lists.

```
>  game.__str__()
>  [[2,3,16,2],[4,16,0,0],[64,0,4,0],[2,0,0,0]]

```

Have fun. I originally built this several years ago as part of an online course on object-oriented programming and data structures.
