This is a simple port of 2048 to python. The scoring is kept simple, and the game allows you to continue even after the 2048 tile has been reached.

I've put together a simple gui for the game, and as of now it requires a few more modules that I have yet to put up. If you're interested, contact me and I can send it to you.
However, if you want to make a gui of your own, feel free to do so! The game board is initialized as a list of lists, so

![game board example](https://raw.github.com/njaladan/2048-python/img/2048game.JPG)

will be shown as:

```
>  game.__str__()
>  [[2,3,16,2],[4,16,0,0],[64,0,4,0],[2,0,0,0]]

```

And that's pretty much it! Just hit me up if you have any questions.
